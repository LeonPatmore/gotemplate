# Go Library Template

Structure based on https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout.

## Examples

For quickly testing changes:

`make run cmd=example`

For building the executable:

`make build cmd=example`

## Go Commands

go install:

```
Compiles the package and installs the resulting binary in the $GOPATH/bin directory (or $GOBIN if set).
Typically used for creating executables that you want to reuse from anywhere in your terminal.
Example: go install ./... installs all packages in the current module.
```

go build:
```
Compiles the source code in the specified package and produces a binary executable in the current directory (or outputs to the specified location).
It does not install the binary, so itâ€™s useful for local builds when you want to run the binary immediately.
Example: go build will create a binary with the same name as the directory.
```

go run:
```
Compiles and runs the Go program in a single command without creating a binary file.
Ideal for quick testing or running small scripts.
Example: go run main.go executes the program in main.go.
```
